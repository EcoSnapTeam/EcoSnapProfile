Theme : Sustainable Futures: Nurturing harmony between humanity and the environment

Project Name: EcoSnap

# Summary/Abstract

EcoSnap is a mobile application designed to tackle the global issue of waste mismanagement by empowering users to make informed choices about recycling and disposal. Our project addresses a common problem: lack of awareness about proper waste disposal, leading to increased landfill usage and environmental harm. EcoSnap enables users to identify waste types simply by taking a photo, using machine learning to recognize materials like plastic, glass, paper, or organic matter. The app then provides tailored disposal and recycling recommendations, helping users reduce their environmental footprint.
